## Web-Based Interior Pre-Visualization Tool for Low-Cost Housing Renovation

### The Daily Problem

Homeowners, particularly those living in low-cost housing, often struggle to visualize whether appliances or furniture will properly fit within small or irregularly shaped spaces before making a purchase. This lack of visualization frequently results in poor purchasing decisions, wasted money, and inefficient use of limited living areas.

### The Solution

The proposed system is a web-based interior pre-visualization tool that allows users to input accurate room dimensions and interactively drag and drop 3D models of standard furniture and appliances into a virtual space. This enables homeowners to test different layouts in advance, evaluate spatial fit, and make informed decisions prior to renovation or purchase.
